# simple-snake-game

This game was created using [Think like a programmer: How to build Snake using only JavaScript, HTML & CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/think-like-a-programmer-how-to-build-snake-using-only-javascript-html-and-css-7b1479c3339e/) article as a template.  

I have added a Game Over statement and a Reset button.

The [link](https://ngolodets.github.io/simple-snake-game/) to the working version.
